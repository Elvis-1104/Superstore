***1. Project Overview:***

In this project I have used Python for Importing, Cleaning and performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the Superstore dataset uploaded on the official website of 
Kaggle. The libraries used throughout the cycle of this project include Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. Tableau is been used to create a dashboard summarizing all the
important visuals related to the analysis performed.


***2. Objectives:***

-> Identifying product categories and sub-categories which yeilds negative profit margins.<br>
-> Finding the role of Discounts and Shipping methods on the profitability.<br>
-> Recommending the necessary actions to be taken to minimize the overall lose of the retail store.


***3. Tools & Technologies:***

-> Python: For Data Analysis<br>
-> Tableau: For Dashboard<br>
-> Jupyter Notebook: Code Execution


***4. Key Insights:***

-> Sub-categories Binders and Appliances under the category of Office Supplies shows negative profit margins consistently.<br>
-> High Discounts on any product leads to the noticeable decline in the profits.<br>
-> Standard Class is the most profitable shipping mode among all.


***5. Recommendations:***

-> Pricing adjustments and quality check is to be done of the sub-categories with negative profit margins to remarkably reduce the loss.<br>
-> Discount Optimization is need to be implemented, it should be below the threshold where profit turns into negative.<br>
-> Shipping Strategy should be enhanced by promoting more efficient shipping modes such as Standard Class and Second Class.
